# US Environmental History Maps

This project is a web-based map viewer for exploring the environmental history of the United States. It was created as a final project for a Cartography course.

## Features

The application provides 7 different map views:

1. **Old World (Topographical)** - A topographical map of the United States before state boundaries were established.
2. **American Colonies (European Latitude Comparison)** - This map explores the original American Colonies by comparing latitude lines to Europe.
3. **Midwest (Resource Commodification & Railroads)** - This map explores the Midwest with the theme of resource commodification and railroad lines.
4. **Southern Plantations** - This map explores the South with a focus on Southern plantations.
5. **The West (Rectangular Survey System)** - This map explores the West using the Rectangular Survey System.
6. **Modern US Infrastructure & Roadways** - This map gives an overview of all 50 US States with a focus on modern infrastructure and roadways.
7. **Global Interconnectedness (Airport Networks)** - This map explores contemporary themes of interconnectedness and sustainability thinking through a global map of airports.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click on the different map options in the sidebar to view each map
3. Read the description for each map in the information section below the map
